# I am using this repo as a test of syncing a local repo with a remote of the same name, without cloning the remote repo first.
## Steps involved are:
* Create local project directory
* Add some files, including this one
* start git bash
* navigate to the new project directory I just created
* run git add . to put all files in the staging area for the first time
* run git commit to add all the files to the local repo
* run git remote add origin https://github.com/paramulator/another_test.git
* run git push

Hopefully this works and I have local and remote repos synced!
